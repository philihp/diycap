# Experience

Progressing industry is usually limited by your finances, your skills, and your ability to manage complexity.

## Finances

You should have between 5-10 billion to do this. There are some lowsec drops that are just
stupid to try to farm. There's also wormhole gas, some of which only comes from C5/C6 wormholes.

## Skills

At a minimum, you will want the following skills:

- Capital Ship Construction I
- Industry V
- Advanced Industry V
- Mechanics V
- Science V
- High Energy Physics IV
- Electronic Engineering IV
- Hydromagnetic Physics IV
- Electromagnetic Physics IV
- Molecular Engineering IV

Capital Ship Construction needs to be trained to IV to do the final build, but you can do most of the steps here
with just rank I.

There are some optional skills which are useful to have, and I will call those out as we get to them as well
as alternatives to training them. If you have extra training time, train these on all of your characters for
more reaction slots and faster reactions:

- Reactions III or higher, for 4% faster reactions per level
- Mass Reactions IV
- Mass Reactions V, then Advanced Mass Reactions III

The first will get you 15 reaction slots per account. The second will get you a total of 27 reactions per account.

I shouldn't have to say this, but if I don't then someone will yell at me. You need to have:

- Advanced Spaceship Command I
- Amarr Freighter I (or whichever race)

You'll need this to hop in the Providence and pilot it over from the "Basic Large" structure to the
"Adv Large" structure. I guess you'll also want the Freighter IV skill to pilot your finished Jump
Freighter, but I guess you don't _need_ that to build it.
