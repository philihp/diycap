# Blueprints

## Get some Blueprints

Acquire the following BPCs and runs.

The easiest way to get these is from a BPC pack from
[Beaver's Capital BPC Store](https://goonfleet.com/index.php/topic/210926-beavers-capital-bpc-store-siege-green-updated/).

Get a Freighter BPC with ME-9 or ME-10. Because of rounding, with a T1 rigged structure, you don't get much gain from
researching past ME-9. Your other components should be ME-10.

### Buy one

You can buy this off of contracts. The going rate is about 50m per run, although higher ME is significantly better.

|  ME | Approx Cost Per Run | &Delta; |
| --: | :------------------ | ------- |
|   0 | 6.470b              | 0       |
|   1 | 6.417b              | -53m    |
|   2 | 6.363b              | -107m   |
|   3 | 6.331b              | -139m   |
|   4 | 6.314b              | -156m   |
|   5 | 6.271b              | -198m   |

### Invent one

Acquire a bunch of Providence BPCs. Any ME, it doesn't matter. You can buy your own BPO for [1.9b](https://evemarketer.com/types/20184) from
an NPC sell order, and copy it yourself, but IIRC the copy times are like 3+ days, even with proper rigs.

Inject and/or train the following skills to III. These skillbooks are each 20m each. You should already have Molecular Engineering to IV.

- Amarr Starship Engineering III
- Amarr Encryption Methods III

Invent with an **Optimized Attainment** decryptor.

| Decryptor              | Odds | Runs |  ME |  TE |
| :--------------------- | ---: | ---: | --: | --: |
| Process                |  25% |    1 |   5 |  10 |
| Optimized Augmentation |  21% |    8 |   4 |   4 |
| Accelerant             |  28% |    2 |   4 |  14 |
| Parity                 |  34% |    4 |   3 |   2 |
| Optimized Attainment   |  44% |    3 |   3 |   2 |
| Symmetry               |  23% |    3 |   3 |  12 |
| Attainment             |  41% |    5 |   1 |   8 |
| None                   |  23% |    1 |   2 |   4 |
| Augmentation           |  14% |   10 |   0 |   6 |

These probabilities were generated from [Ravworks](https://ravworks.com/invention). This can be a matter
of taste, and you might be able to save a few hundred million by decrypting with Process, you'll burn
through a lot of Providence BPCs trying to hit that 25% chance, and it takes about a week to roll the dice
once.

### Pick a GEZ

Find Kun'mi's GEZ spreadsheet [in this thread](https://goonfleet.com/index.php/topic/314230-gez-goonswarm-economic-zones-order-damnit/)
and pick a GEZ system to do your build.

There is no right answer here; some systems have T2 rigged structures instead of T1,
but those tend to have higher industry indexes. It's quite nice to be a couple jumps away
from 1DQ. [NOFU](http://northernfreightunlimited.com) will ship directly to W-IX39 for
a little bit more though. W-IX39 is also way out in Querious, so there's quite a bit of
danger in that it would likely be the first to fall if we're invaded and once
an industry job is started, you can't stop it.

### Drop your BPCs in the appropriate structures

Fly around in a shuttle in your system with your blueprints. Dock up in each
structure and look at the blueprint in the industry browser. If you mouse-over
this bit, you'll see the bonuses applied. You want to make sure the rig bonus
applies.
