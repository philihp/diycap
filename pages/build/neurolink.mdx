# U-C Trigger Neurolink Conduits

You'll need 14 of these for the Providence, and 30 for the Ark. Each race has a
different version, needing gas from different regions.

### Huff the gas

| Type                  | Amount |
| :-------------------- | -----: |
| Lime Mykoserocin      |   2934 |
| Malachite Mykoserocin |   2934 |
| Lime Cytoserocin      |     49 |
| Malachite Cytoserocin |     49 |

You can get this yourself with a venture in
[Aridia, Khanid, Catch, and Delve](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Gas_cloud_harvesting#Mykoserocin).
You can also buy it, just keep in mind that it's 10mÂ³ per unit, so work that into your
shipping calculations.

### Lowsec Drops

You'll also need 80 LM-Composite Molecular Condensers. They drop in lowsec from data sites. Just buy them.
