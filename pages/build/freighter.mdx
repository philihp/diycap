# Build the Freighter

These components are shared among most capital ships, in various amounts.

I'm also going to include the Capital Jump Drives here, since they're similar to other components,
however save it for last because you won't need it until the Ark build.

### Move P1 to the Adv Components structure

Empire scientists reverse-engineered Triglavian technology to make building ships more
complicated, and require PI. Now we can't go back to the old way. This is going to be
cheapest if you buy it in 1DQ. P1 can't be compressed, and isn't worth enough to import,
so all of it has to be farmed locally.

| Type     | Amount |
| :------- | -----: |
| Water    |   7235 |
| Oxygen   |   9646 |
| Proteins |   3858 |
| Bacteria |   7717 |

### Move Minerals to the Capital Components structure

TODO: tally up how much minerals

## Build Pipeline

### Life Support and Preservation Seals

- Build 342 Auto-Integrity Preservation Seals
- Build 171 Life Support Backup Units

### Capital Parts

- Build 13 Capital Propulsion Engines
- Build 5 Armor Plates
- Build 35 Capital Cargo Bays
- Build 5 Capital Construction Parts
- Build 28 Capital Jump Drives _you don't need to wait on this to build the Providence_

### Build the Providence

This should take about 5 days, but while you wait you can move on to reacting moongoo for the T2 parts.

Once it's done, you may need to assemble it and pilot it over to the "Adv Large" Raitaru, it's too
big to fit into any other ship.
