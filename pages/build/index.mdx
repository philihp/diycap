# Overview

The progression of an industrialist usually goes:

1. T2 Modules
2. T2 Ships (Dictors and Stealth Bombers, then HACs, then Marauders)
3. T3 Ships
4. Capital Ships

Building a Jump Freighter is a bit like building any other T2 ship, and straddles the line between
Battleship and Capital ship. A freighter uses capital ship components, similar to a Dread, but a Dread
must be built in a large (Azbel) or extra-large (Sotiyo) with a [Capital Shipyard](https://everef.net/type/35881),
but a Freighter can be built in a medium (Raitaru) with just [Manufacturing Plant](https://everef.net/type/35878).
A freighter also gets bonuses from the [rig](https://everef.net/type/43863) for "Large" ships.

Just like all T2 production, first you build the T1 ship, and then you react a fuckton of moongoo
and augment the ship to be the T2 variety.
