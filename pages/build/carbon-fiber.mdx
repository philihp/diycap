# Reinforced Carbon Fiber

You're going to need a lot of reinforced carbon fiber, in almost every component of this ship. You
could react all of it at once and then use it as you need it, but since it's a two-part reaction,
it makes sense to do it in batches of a couple days. It's like cooking pizza rolls. You could do
the entire bag all at once in the big oven, or you could do a couple dozen at a time in the
toaster-oven, and have some to munch on while the rest are cooking.

### Build Pipeline

1. React Intermediates

   - 2&half; days worth of Carbon Fiber
   - 2&half; days worth of Thermosetting Polymer
   - &half; day worth of Oxy-Organic Solvents

2. React Composites

   - 2&half; days worth of Reinforced Carbon Fiber

Constantly have these 3-4 reactions running. Maybe have multiple copies of them.
