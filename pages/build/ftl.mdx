# FTL Interlink Communicators

You need 3 of these, 1 for the Providence and 2 for the Ark.

## Buy them

I sell these for 125m each. Like the CCTRs, you can manufacture them yourself, but
I think it makes sense to buy these from someone mass producing them. Each race
has their own type, and training just to build them is stupid.

## Build them

Unlike the CCTRs, if you build these just build them all at once. When you run the
[hybrid polymers](https://everef.net/groups/974), you won't need to run more than a
few runs of most, and having to babysit short run jobs is a drag.

### Train

- Jump Drive Calibration V

I'm not going to tell you why you need this, but if you don't already
have it and you're trying to build FTL Interlinks, you're doing it wrong.

- Electronic Engineering V
- Quantum Physics V

Also one of these:

- High Energy Physics V (Radar, for an Ark)
- Plasma Physics V (Magnetometric, for an Anshar)
- Nuclear Physics Physics V (Ladar, for a Nomad)
- Electromagnetic Physics V (Gravimetric, for a Rhea)

And once you've done that, fuck it YOLO train the other 3 and undercut me on these components,
because you've done most of the work already. I won't be hurt, I'll be relieved.

### Farm some gas

Probably the most annoying thing here is getting the Fullerite. It only comes from
wormholes, and I think the C320 and C540 only comes from C5/C6 wormholes. It's also
pretty voluminous so importing it is expensive. If you buy them in Jita, try to
get them compressed, but compare the compressed with uncompressed and consider that
you lose 5-10% from decompression (based on your Gas Compression skill). Also notice
that each Fullerite has a different size, which impacts shipping cost.

| Gas            | Amount |
| :------------- | -----: |
| Fullerite-C28  |   1663 |
| Fullerite-C32  |   2348 |
| Fullerite-C50  |    490 |
| Fullerite-C60  |    294 |
| Fullerite-C70  |    294 |
| Fullerite-C72  |    196 |
| Fullerite-C84  |    979 |
| Fullerite-C320 |    783 |
| Fullerite-C540 |    881 |

### Get some minerals

Get the Pyerite, Mexallon, Tritanium, Isogen, Nocxium, Zydrine, and Megacyte listed in your BPC.

### Get some P4

Also get 6 Broadcast Nodes, 3 Wetware Mainframes, and 3 Self-Harmonizing Power Cores.

4. Build the FTL Interlink

For the rig bonuses, this should be done in the **"Adv Component"** structure. If there are multiple in the system, do the T2 one.

_Don't_ do this in the "Capital Component" structure, that has the wrong rig. What, did you think this was a capital component?
