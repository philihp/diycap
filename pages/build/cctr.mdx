# Capital Core Temperature Regulators

You will need 2 of these; one for the Providence, and then one for the Ark.

## Buy them

I sell these for 1 billion each. You can manufacture your own, but there's a large skill barrier and
every ship bigger than a Rorqual needs one of them, so there should be at least some sort of market
volume for them.

## Build them

If you build these, build one and then the other, because you'll want the first done
sooner to kick off the Providence build, and you just need the second finished before
the final Ark build.

### Train

- Hydromagnetic Physics V
- Mechanical Engineering V

Also, to get additional reaction slots, train these if you haven't, because you'll
need more reaction slots.

- Mass Reactions V (on all of your characters)
- Advanced Mass Reactions III (on all of your characters)

### Buy more copies of these reactions

In addition to what you have, get more copies of the following reactions. At least
3 more of each.

- Sulfuric Acid Reaction Formula
- Pressurized Oxidizers Reaction Formula
- Reinforced Carbon Fiber Reaction Formula
- Carbon Polymers Reaction Formula
- Carbon Fiber Reaction Formula
- Thermosetting Polymer Reaction Formula

You should have an Oxy-Organic Solvents reaction, and if you get more than 5 sets of the above reactions,
get another one of these for every 5 sets, so if you have 12 of each of the above, you should have 3 solvent reactions.

### Get a bunch of P4

- 86 Integrity Response Drones
- 86 Self-Harmonizing Power Cores

If you're building these cores, it may make sense to build the PI yourself.

### Get a bunch of P1

- 6k Water
- 6k Chiral Structures

Just buy it off the market. Fun fact: this used to require 85x as much Water, because Kenneth Feld
is a terrible CSM rep.

### Get a bunch of R4

- 80k Hydrocarbons
- 80k Atmospheric Gases
- 30k Silicates
- 30k Evaporite Deposits

### Build Pipeline

Augment your [RCF](carbon-fiber) pipeline, and add Pressurized Oxidizers.

1. Intermediate Reactions (10 days)

   - React 130 Oxy-Organic Solvents
   - React 25.4k Carbon Polymers
   - React 25.4k Sulfuric Acid
   - React 25.4k Thermosetting Polymer
   - React 25.4k Carbon Fiber

2. Composite Reactions (about 10 days)

   - React 25.8k of Pressurized Oxidizers
   - React 25.8k of Reinforced Carbon Fiber

3. Build 60 Core Temperature Regulators (about 2 days)

This should be done in the **"Adv Component"** structure. If there are multiple in the system, do the T2 one.

4. Build 1 Capital Core Temperature Regulator

This should be done in the **"Capital Component"** Raitaru.
