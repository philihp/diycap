# Introduction

Having a Jump Freighter is a huge quality of life improvement for anyone
living in nullsec, and with the current tether mechanics and proper discipline
there's no reason you should ever lose one.

With a minimal amount of skill training, you can also build your own for about
half the cost; most of the work is moving things around and identifying the
critical path so as to run everything in parallel, and this guide aims to help with that.

# Scope

The following things are out of scope, either because I don't know much about it
or I don't think it's worth your time.

- Fuel Blocks: I assume you already have a setup for building these.
- Acquiring Minerals: just buy it off the market and [import them](http://northernfreightunlimited.com).
- Planetary Interaction: too much work to setup just for one ship.
- Building outside of a GEZ: I don't know what structures you have.

# Caveat

It's really annoying to provide exact numbers, due to some structures having T1 vs
T2 rigs. I'll overestimate, and maybe (probably not) come back later with better numbers.
